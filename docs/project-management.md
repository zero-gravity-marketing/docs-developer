# Project Management

At ZGM, our developers need to understand how to properly estimate and manage their time.  The first step to creating a timeline is determing how many `hours` we have to build/implement the thing.  Below is a simple calculator to help this process.  Put in your `dev hours` and watch the number of weeks get calculated.  This should be used as a starting point to figure out how long the thing will take.

## Calculator

::: tip

* **Estimated Weeks** = Hourly Budget / 5 hrs (daily) / 5 days (work week) 
* **To be Safe** = Estimated Weeks + Q/A (25%) + Shit Happens (10%)
* **\*Note: **This calculation assumes 1 developer is working on the project.

## Timeline

Once you have determined how long the thing will take, you need to create your milestones. Once every step is completed a button will appear which will let you copy your timeline and get it into our project management system.
